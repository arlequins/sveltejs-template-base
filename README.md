# svelte app - custom template

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/arlequins/sveltejs-template-base.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit arlequins/sveltejs-template-base svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Deploying to the web
